# HelloWorld
My first repository - Starter Hello World

This repository is used for me to learn Github usage. This is the first time for me to make a project on Github.
This Code is just a toy.
I start it during the Chinese new year holidays. May it be a hint of new start!
Wish you be happy!

During finishing my profile, I need a random Icon picture for avatar. 
May be I can write a program. It can make pictures according to certain function.
Let's try it!
